 <p class="col-sm-6">1 Always use a 3-wire line cord with neutral (green) connected to the instrument case. Instruments with ungrounded cases can become lethal devices in the event of transformer insulation failure or accidental connection ofonesideofthepower line to the case. With a grounded case, such a failure simply blows a fuse. You often seeinstrumentswiththeline cord attached tothe chassis (permanently) using a plastic "strain relief,"made by Heycoor Richco. A better way is to use an IEC three-prong male chassis-mounted connector, to mate with those popular line cords that have the three-prong IEC female molded onto the end. That way the line cord is conveniently removable. Better yet, you can get a combined "power entry module," containing IEC connector, fuse holder, line filter,andswitch (as described later). Note that ac wiring uses a nonintuitive color convention: black = "hot," white = neutral, and green = ground</p>
